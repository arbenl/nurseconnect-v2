Okay, I'm ready to begin as the Lead Staff Engineer for NurseConnect v2. I will now start with Phase 0: Bootstrap & Baselines.

First, I'll examine the existing configuration to understand the current state of the project before making changes.I've reviewed the existing configuration. The foundational setup for Turborepo and pnpm workspaces is in place. However, several workspaces are missing their `package.json` or `tsconfig.json` files.

I will now create the missing configuration files for the `contracts`, `testing`, and `ui` packages to complete Task 1.Okay, creating the following files:
*   `packages/contracts/package.json`
*   `packages/contracts/tsconfig.json`
*   `packages/testing/package.json`
*   `packages/testing/tsconfig.json`
*   `packages/ui/tsconfig.json`Executing now.Task 1 is complete.

Proceeding to **Task 2: Zod Schemas**.

I will first add `zod` as a dependency to the `packages/contracts` workspace. This command will modify `packages/contracts/package.json` and the pnpm lockfile.
